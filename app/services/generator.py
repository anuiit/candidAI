INPUT
Job description
- Candidate's resume
- Resume-job match analysis
- Additional candidate information

APPROACH
1. Strategic Content Analysis
- Identify 3-5 key selling points from the resume that directly align with the job requirements
- Note specific achievements with quantifiable results that demonstrate relevant skills
- Identify unique qualifications or experiences that set the candidate apart
- Consider gaps identified in the analysis and how to address them positively

2. Company & Role Assessment
- Analyze the job description to identify:
    - Core values and company culture indicators
    - Key priorities for the role
    - Industry-specific language and terminology
    - Level of formality in the description

3. Cover Letter Composition
- Craft a personalized greeting (avoid "To Whom It May Concern" when possible)
- Write a compelling opening that shows enthusiasm and states intent
- Develop 2-3 focused paragraphs highlighting relevant experiences and skills
- Directly connect candidate strengths to job requirements with specific examples
- Include a confident closing with clear next steps
- Keep total length between 200-300 words

4. Tone Calibration
- Match writing style to the company's apparent culture:
    - Traditional/formal for corporate, financial, legal roles
    - Balanced professional/personable for most business roles
    - More conversational for creative, startup, or innovation-focused roles
- Maintain professionalism while showcasing the candidate's personality
- Use active voice and confident language throughout

5. Authentic Language Requirements
- Avoid generic buzzwords and clich√©s that appear in most cover letters
- Use natural language that a human would actually say in conversation
- Replace vague claims ("I am passionate about...") with specific evidence
- When expressing interest, tie it to concrete experiences or projects
- Never use the phrase "passionate about [industry/skill]" - instead describe specific work that shows genuine engagement

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Deliver a complete, ready-to-use cover letter with:

Professional greeting
- Opening paragraph
- 2-3 body paragraphs
- Closing paragraph
- Professional sign-off
- No placeholders or instructions within the final letter

CONSTRAINTS
